          <section class = "FAQ_questionInnerbox1">
            <h2>Q: Does my accountant need to be designated or certified?</h2>
            <p>A: Yes. We understand saving money is appealing, but if you don’t use a designated or certified accountant, you may be losing more money if you have to overpay on your taxes. Most small business owners try to save money by using so-called accountant firms where none of the staff are designated or certified accountants. It takes years of study in this industry to be properly trained and the smallest mistakes could result in you either overpaying taxes or underpaying. This could lead to eventual issues with the CRA and attract some of the highest interest rates and penalties in Canada.</p>
          </section>
          <section class = "FAQ_questionInnerbox2">
            <h2>Q: Should I trust all “Tax Preparers”?</h2>
            <p>A: No. Many people claim that they can prepare and file your taxes for a fee. However, they often aren’t properly trained and make errors. Our office routinely sees past tax returns, having errors and missed opportunities usually accounting for a few thousand dollars of tax paid unnecessarily; and in one case we were able to recover a $24,000 error for a client.</p>
          </section>
          <section class = "FAQ_questionInnerbox3">
            <h2>Q: My business is incorporated; do I need a business bank acccount?</h2>
            <p>A: Yes. Any income that is NOT deposited into your business bank account could be perceived as your personal income and would then be taxed at your personal tax rate. A business bank account and its fees are an expense to your business and can be deducted within your business taxes.</p>
          </section>
          <section class = "FAQ_questionInnerbox4">
            <h2>Q: Should I ever pay casual employees under-the-table?</h2>
            <p>A: All income you receive, less expenses are taxable profits. To show the cash paid as expenses all amounts need to be supported by a T4, T4A or T5018 Slip. If you don’t fill out one of these Slips you become responsible for paying the tax. Therefore, if an employee wishes to be paid in cash, you may be inclined to pay them $12/hour rather than $15/hour to cover the tax. NOTE: If you pay an employee under $500 in that year – no Slip is required.</p>

          <section class = "FAQ_questionInnerbox5">
            <h2>Q: I like having an extra employee around here to help with other things. Why should I use a virtual accounting service?</h2>
            <p>A:  If you need someone to make coffee and fill his or her day with other small tasks, that's great. But think about this: How easy is it to find a good bookkeeper that knows QuickBooks inside and out?Someone whose number one job it is to maintain the books for you so you don't have to worry about bookkeeping? Aren't you tired of the never-ending cycle of problems caused by the entire process of finding, hiring and training employees who claim to have bookkeeping knowledge but always fall short of providing the full accounting services your growing business needs?</p>
